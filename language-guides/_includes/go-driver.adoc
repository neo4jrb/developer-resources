The Neo4j Go driver is *officially supported* by Neo4j and connects to the database using the binary bolt protocol.
It aims to be minimal, while being idiomatic to Go.

=== Module version
Make sure your application has been setup to use go modules (there should be a go.mod file in your application root). Add the driver with:

[source, shell, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
go mod edit -require github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver@<the tag>
----

=== With `go get`

Add the driver with

[source, shell, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/neo4j
----

[source, go, subs="attributes"]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/{go-driver-version}/neo4j/test-integration/examples_test.go[tag=hello-world,indent=0]
